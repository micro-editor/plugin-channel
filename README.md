## Adding your own plugin

To add your own plugin, create a `repo.json` file containing all the metadata information for your plugin. See the Go plugin [repo.json](https://github.com/micro-editor/go-plugin/blob/master/repo.json) file as an example.

Then you can open a pull request which adds the link to that file to the `channel.json` file in this repo.
