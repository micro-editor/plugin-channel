## Adding your own plugin

To add your own plugin, create a `repo.json` file containing all the metadata
information for your plugin. See the Go plugin
[repo.json](https://github.com/micro-editor/go-plugin/blob/master/repo.json)
file as an example.

Then create a `plugins/plugin.json` file in this repository that specifies the
zip file to download for the versions of micro you support. Point the zip files
to the `plugins` release, like the other plugins, even though the zip will not
exist at the time when you create the JSON file.

Then you can open a pull request which adds the link to that file to the
`channel.json` file in this repo, and upload or provide a link to the zip
files in your PR. If you PR is accepted, I will upload those zip files to
the `plugins` release so they will be accessible to all micro users.

Please make sure to add a License to your plugin.

## Updating your plugin

If you come out with a new version of your plugin, please open a PR modifying
the `plugins/plugin.json` with your new version. Upload or provide a link to
the zip file. When the update is approved I will upload this file to the
`plugins` release.
